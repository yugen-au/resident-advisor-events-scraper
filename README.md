## Usage

### Command-Line Interface
Use the command-line tool for advanced event scraping:

```bash
python event_fetcher.py <area_id> <start_date> <end_date> [options]
```

**Available Options:**
- `-o, --output` - Output file path (default: events.csv)
- `-g, --genre` - Filter by genre (e.g., 'techno', 'house')
- `-t, --event-type` - Filter by event type (e.g., 'club', 'festival')
- `-s, --sort` - Sort by: listingDate, score, or title (default: listingDate)
- `--no-bumps` - Exclude bumped/promoted events

**Examples:**
```bash
# Basic usage
python event_fetcher.py 1 2025-08-10 2025-08-17 -o sydney_events.csv

# Filter by genre
python event_fetcher.py 1 2025-08-10 2025-08-17 --genre techno -o techno_events.csv

# Sort by popularity and exclude bumped events
python event_fetcher.py 1 2025-08-10 2025-08-17 --sort score --no-bumps -o popular_events.csv

# Combined filtering
python event_fetcher.py 1 2025-08-10 2025-08-17 -g house -t club -s score -o house_club_events.csv
```

### Flask API Server
Start the API server:

```bash
python app.py
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:8080` (or the PORT environment variable).

### Batch Processing Benefits

**üöÄ Efficiency**: Query multiple targets in one API call instead of making separate requests

**‚è±Ô∏è Rate Limiting**: Built-in delays (500ms-1s) between requests to respect RA's API limits

**üìä Comprehensive Results**: Get detailed statistics and summaries for all batch operations

**üõ°Ô∏è Error Handling**: Individual query failures don't stop the entire batch operation

**üíæ Reduced Overhead**: Lower network overhead and faster overall processing

**üéØ Batch Limits**: 
- Artists/Labels: Max 10 queries per batch
- Events: Max 5 areas per batch  
- Mixed search: Max 15 total queries per batch
